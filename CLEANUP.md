# 🗑️ Files to Delete

## Files We're Deleting (Old/Unrealistic Versions):

### Smart Contracts:
- ❌ `Smart-contract/PropertyGuardian.sol` - OLD (unrealistic, has AI buzzwords)
- ✅ `Smart-contract/PropertyRegistry.sol` - KEEP (new, honest version)

### Documentation:
- ❌ `README.md` - OLD (unrealistic promises)
- ❌ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - OLD (overpromises)
- ❌ `QUICKSTART.md` - References old approach
- ✅ `README-HONEST.md` - KEEP (realistic version)
- ✅ `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - KEEP (still valid)
- ✅ `FRONTEND_COMPLETE.md` - KEEP (still valid)
- ✅ `BEFORE_VS_AFTER.md` - KEEP (explains changes)
- ✅ `REDESIGN_SUMMARY.md` - KEEP (quick reference)

### Frontend:
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - KEEP (main page)
- ✅ All components - KEEP
